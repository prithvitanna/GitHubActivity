Once upon a time there was a rat that loved to cook. However, his family didn't approve. They said rats weren't meant to cook. One day, a flood caused an overflow of 
water in the sewers where the rat lived. The rat was seperated from his family and all other rats and didn't know what to do. When the rat realized he was in Paris, he 
decided to local for the most popular restaurant. There he found an underwhelming cook.

The cook and the rat became friends, and the rat agreed to teach the cook how to make delicious meals. He sat atop his head and tugged his hair one way or another in order to instruct the cook on what to do. Together, they made some of the most deliicous meals. Patrons came from near and far to taste the best Paris had to offer. 

The cook had a dark secret. He had been jealous of the rat since they first met. The cook was overwhelmed with rage and jealousy at the thought of a rat outcooking him time and time again. It was time for him to finally cut the rat out of his life and move on in his own cullinary journey. At the break of dawn the cook stole the amazing creme fresh recipie the rat had been guarding for years and stole out of town on his favorite vespa.
